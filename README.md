# ml-forestfires
A program that uses the Random Forest regressor to predict the number of acres burned in a forest fire, given environmental data.

I applied the machine learning regression Random Forest, which predicts the amount of land damaged by analyzing environmental data from the Fire Weather Index. I used Python with Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit libraries to prepare, train, and test this data with 95.08% accuracy.

I chose to employ Random Forest because each variable is independent from the other, and there are enough of these variables to create many individual decision trees. My dataset included hundreds of data points, but still needed to become effective if tested with a relatively small amount of data. Thus, Random Forest became the most effective option.
